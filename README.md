# SPRiNT: Time-resolved parameterization of aperiodic and periodic brain activityÂ  

Code for simulating dynamic neural time series, spectrogram parameterization (using SPRiNT), and generating figures from the SPRiNT preprint.

**SPRiNT** is an MATLAB toolbox. This package has an associated [article](https://mc-stan.org/) where we validate the method on both simulated and empirical data.

# Information

The SPRiNT algorithm is also available from the [Brainstorm distribution](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Introduction) (Tadel et al., 2011). See the [Brainstorm website](https://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/SPRiNT?highlight=%28SPRiNT%29) for a tutorial on how to run SPRiNT

Code for simulating time series (see [Study 1](https://mc-stan.org/)) can be found in timeseries_sim.m. Code for generating the figure for Study 1 & 3 can be found in the Figures folder. Code for the EEG dataset (see [Study 2](https://mc-stan.org/)) can be found in LEMON_analysis_script.R.
