# SPRiNT: Time-resolved parameterization of aperiodic and periodic brain activityÂ  

Code for simulating neural time series, spectrogram parameterization (using SPRiNT), and generating figures from the SPRiNT preprint.

**SPRiNT** is an MATLAB toolbox. This package has an associated [article](https://mc-stan.org/) where we validate the method on both simulated and empirical data.
